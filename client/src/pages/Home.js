      <p>I am a quantitative analyst (quant) currently working at Citigroup, NYC. I hold a PhD in physics where I developed numerical libraries to study the fascinating world of quantum materials. Not only our tool explained the complicated physical properties of real materials, our tool was also shown to have a robust predictive ability.

I am passionate about cricket data analysis and learning about the world of finance through an economic lens around the world.</p>
