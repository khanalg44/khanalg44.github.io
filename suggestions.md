**I want to learn ML what to do?**

Machine Learning requires a somewhat strong background on Math, Algebra, Calculus and programming language skills. There are many online resources as well as tutorials that you can learn from. I'd suggest the following things.

- Intro to ML course from Andrew Ng in Coursera, this course is free .

- Work on your python skills, start simple and build on top of that for something sophisticated.

- This book is a nice one: Python Data Science Handbook Essential Tools for Working with Data by Jake VanderPlas.

- Open an account in Kaggle and go through other people's codes to understand how others do ML.

I hope this helps.
